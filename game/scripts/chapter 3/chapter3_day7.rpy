    "She always says she keeps an eye on me through the corner of her eye, but I'm not gonna try to hurt her again. I learned my lesson."

    "I make sure everything is saved and shut down the laptop."
    "Well then."
    "I can't leave the room without her, so I guess I'm not having lunch."
    "Oh well. I'll survive."
