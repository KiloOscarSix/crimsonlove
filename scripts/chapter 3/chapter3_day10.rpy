    kana "You do realise that's breaking the monitoring rules, right?"
    interface "Yes, I'm aware. However, there is a fine line between \"monitoring\" and \"stalking\"."
    interface "I did not want to cross that line."
    kana "Fair point. Carry on."
    interface "I felt something grab me from behind, and was thrown into the bath, and twisted my arm because of the way I fell."
    "Oh... So that's why she screamed."
    "I didn't realise..."
    interface "I sat up to remove my arm from the position. Alex was being very condescending and threatening. I should have sent a distress signal, but felt she wouldn't do more harm."
    interface "I was wrong."
    "..."

    "I don't... It happened exactly as she said. But..."
    my "Well, yes. It did happen just as she said. However, I must add that I perceived her as a threat to me and Hareka, and was acting in self-defense."
