    my "This one was about a doctor who was reincarnated as his new cousin."
    "We sit down on the floor."
    my "Do you believe in reincarnation, Hareka?"
    my "I don't, personally. It's a bit ridiculous."
    hareka "I have no opinion really."
    hareka "I sort of agree with you, but there have been some claims recently..."
    my "Yeah..."
    my "Oh well. Let's play chess."
